GW Data Plotter
===============

What does it do?
----------------

TEST CHANGE

**GW Data Plotter** is a desktop application that simplifies access to Gravitational Wave (GW) data 
and facilitates basic visualization and analysis.

The app allows users to download *public* gravitational wave data from the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and 
GEO detectors via the `Gravitational Wave Open Science Center <https://gwosc.org>`_.

Who is it for?
--------------

Accessing and visualizing GW data can be challenging for non-experts. Even though the data is publicly available and the 
software tools to analyze it are open-source, the learning curve can be steep.

**GW Data Plotter** aims to lower this barrier by providing a graphical user interface to improve GW data accessibility. 
Users do not need to be experts in programming to use the app or know the details of the specific software packages 
used in GW data analysis.

Initially developed for scientists outside the GW community wishing to access GW data for their research, the app is also 
intended for students and educators that first enter the field of GW astronomy. 

Serving as a stepping stone, the app helps 
to achieve familiarization with GW data, allowing even novice users to interact with *actual* GW events putting aside the 
technical details.



Installing the app
------------------

- The easiest way to install the app is to download and run the executable file suitable for your operating system from the 
  `Zenodo repository`_. 
- Executable files are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
